# Assignment Description
This is a simple website created for a homework assignment for CS1301: Introduction to Computing.

Students were allowed to create a website on whichever topic they desired. I chose to make my website about macarons and is in French, naturally.

The website includes css formatting for buttons, tables, images and links.
